# Encoding merger control rules - development

This is a wire frame to explore whether the encoding of legal merger control rules can be facilitated by a visual programming interface. That is, can a visual programming interface help lawyers communicate with developers during the rule encoding process.

The interface is running here https://multi-j-coding.herokuapp.com/.

The interface is built on Blockly. Blockly is a library from Google for building beginner-friendly block-based programming languages. See further https://developers.google.com/blockly.
