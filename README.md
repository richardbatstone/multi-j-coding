# Encoding merger control rules - development

This is a wire frame to explore whether the encoding of legal merger control rules can be facilitated by a visual programming interface. That is, can a visual programming interface help lawyers communicate with developers during the rule encoding process.

The interface is running here: https://multi-j-coding.herokuapp.com/. I have made no attempt to package or serve this properly. The php in the repo exists solely to trick Heroku into deploying the static assets.

The interface is built on Blockly. Blockly is a library from Google for building beginner-friendly block-based programming languages. See further https://developers.google.com/blockly.
